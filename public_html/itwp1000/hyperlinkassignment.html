			<h2>Jesus of Suburbia Lyrics</h2>
		
			<em>By Green Day</em>
		<br>
		
		<p>
			<a id="t1"></a>I'm the son of rage and love<br>
			The Jesus of Suburbia<br>
			From the bible of none of the above<br>
			On a steady diet of<br>
			Soda pop and Ritalin<br>
			No one ever died for my sins in hell<br>
			As far as I can tell<br>
			At least the ones I got away with
		</p>
		
		<p>
			<a id="t2"></a>And there's nothing wrong with me<br>
			This is how I'm supposed to be<br>
			In a land of make believe<br>
			That don't believe in me
		</p>
		
		<p>
			<a id="t3"></a>Get my television fix<br>
			Sitting on my crucifix<br>
			The living room or my private womb<br>
			While the Mom's and Brad's are away<br>
			To fall in love and fall in debt<br>
			To alcohol and cigarettes<br>
			And Mary Jane<br>
			To keep me insane,<br>
			Doing someone else's cocaine
		</p>
		
		<p>
			<a id="t4"></a>And there's nothing wrong with me<br>
			This is how I'm supposed to be<br>
			In a land of make believe<br>
			That don't believe in me
		</p>
		
		<p>
			<a id="t5"></a>At the center of the Earth<br>
			In the parking lot<br>
			Of the 7-11 where I was taught<br>
			The motto was just a lie<br>
			It says home is where your heart is<br>
			But what a shame<br>
			'Cause everyone's heart<br>
			Doesn't beat the same<br>
			It's beating out of time
		</p>
		
		<p>
			<a id="t6"></a>City of the dead<br>
			At the end of another lost highway<br>
			Signs misleading to nowhere<br>
			City of the damned<br>
			Lost children with dirty faces today<br>
			No one really seems to care
		</p>
		
		<p>
			<a id="t7"></a>I read the graffiti<br>
			In the bathroom stall<br>
			Like the holy scriptures of a shopping mall<br>
			And so it seemed to confess<br>
			It didn't say much<br>
			But it only confirmed that<br>
			The center of the earth<br>
			Is the end of the world<br>
			And I could really care less
		</p>
		
		<p>
			<a id="t8"></a>City of the dead<br>
			At the end of another lost highway<br>
			Signs misleading to nowhere<br>
			City of the damned<br>
			Lost children with dirty faces today<br>
			No one really seems to care
		</p>
		
		<p>
			I don't care
		</p>
		
		<p>
			<a id="t9"></a>Everyone is so full of sh*t<br>
			Born and raised by hypocrites<br>
			Hearts recycled but never saved<br>
			From the cradle to the grave<br>
			We are the kids of war and peace<br>
			From Anaheim to the middle east<br>
			We are the stories and disciples<br>
			Of the Jesus of suburbia
		</p>
		
		<p>
			<a id="t10"></a>Land of make believe<br>
			And it don't believe in me<br>
			Land of make believe<br>
			And it don't believe<br>
			And I don't care!
		</p>
		
		<p>
			<a id="t11"></a>Dearly beloved are you listening?<br>
			I can't remember a word that you were saying<br>
			Are we demented or am I disturbed?<br>
			The space that's in between insane and insecure
		</p>
		
		<p>
			<a id="t12"></a>Oh, therapy, can you please fill the void?<br>
			Am I retarded or am I just overjoyed?<br>
			Nobody's perfect and I stand accused<br>
			For lack of a better word, and that's my best excuse
		</p>
		
		<p>
			<a id="t13"></a>To live and not to breathe<br>
			Is to die in tragedy<br>
			To run, to run away<br>
			To find what you believe
		</p>
		
		<p>
			And I leave behind<br>
			This hurricane of ***king lies
		</p>
		
		<p>
			<a id="t14"></a>I lost my faith to this<br>
			This town that don't exist<br>
			So I run, I run away<br>
			To the lights of masochists
		</p>
		
		<p>
			<a id="t15"></a>And I leave behind<br>
			This hurricane of ***king lies<br>
			And I walked this line<br>
			A million and one ***king times<br>
			But not this time
		</p>
		
		<p>
			<a id="t16"></a>I don't feel any shame, I won't apologize<br>
			When there ain't nowhere you can go<br>
			Running away from pain when you've been victimized<br>
			Tales from another broken home
		</p>
		
		<p>
			<a id="t17"></a>You're leaving...<br>
			You're leaving...<br>
			You're leaving...<br>
			Ah you're leaving home...
