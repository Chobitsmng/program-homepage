				Kamino's location is what is known as Extragalactic meaning it is outside of the galaxy beyond the outer rim territories. 
				It is in the Kamino star system and is 100% covered in oceans. The Kominoans reside here with several oceanic creatures.
				
				The Kominoans had advanced knowledge of cloning. The sith used this as an advantage to build an army under the nose of
				the Republic forces. When the clone army was later discovered by Obi-wan, the Republic used the clones to fight the 
				Empire just as the sith had planned. This era was known as the Clone Wars and came to an end when Order 66 was carried
				out killing most of the Jedi and turning the clone army to the Empire.
