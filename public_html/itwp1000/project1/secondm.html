			<p>
					Mandalore is located in the outer rim territories of the galaxy.
					It is now an inhospitable desert caused by the many wars that occurred on its surface.
					Most of them civil wars for power over the native Mandalorian people.
					The residents live under domes and have special filtration helmets as a part of their warrior like armor.
			</p>
				<br>
			<p>
					Mandalore was originally part of the republic but was later taken over by the sith and brought to the side of the Empire.
					Jango Fett was a bounty hunter and a native of Mandalore. He was moved to Kamino to be the DNA subject to create the clone army. 
					He requested one clone for himself to raise as his son. His name was Boba.
