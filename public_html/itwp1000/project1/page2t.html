			<p>
				Tatooine is located in the outer rim territories in the Tatoo System.
				Tatooine has 2 stars in its system and is completely covered in desert.
				Moisture farmers create the water needed for the surprisingly large population. Tatooine
				is known for being the home of Luke Skywalker, Jaba The Hutt, and the Sarlacc pit.
				Other residents are the Jawas and the Sand Raiders who are known to attack caravans.

				Tatooine is ruled by the empire but the Hutt Clan controls much of what happens on the planet. Just think of Jaba like a crime syndicate boss.
