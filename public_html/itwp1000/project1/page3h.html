				Hoth is located in the outer rim and is in the Hoth System.
				It is a desolate, frozen tundra planet with almost no life.
				Tauntauns can be found here but the king of this frozen waste land is the Wampa.
				A winter sasquatch type beast with horns and an appetite for meat.

			<p>
				Hoth was a part of the Republic and after the start of the war became a rebel base
				for those who wanted to fight the Empire. Unfortunately, the base is found by
				the Empire and after a quick battle the base is lost and Hoth falls into the hands of the dark side.
